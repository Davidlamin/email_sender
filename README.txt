The Email Application is a Python-based tool that allows users to send emails using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and smtplib for handling email transmission. The application starts with a login screen where users enter their email credentials. Once logged in, users can compose and send emails by providing the recipient's address, subject, and message. The application verifies the validity of email addresses and ensures that all fields are completed before sending the email. It provides feedback on the login status, email sending process, and any errors encountered. The interface is designed to be user-friendly, with clear instructions and feedback, making it a practical tool for managing email communications.
